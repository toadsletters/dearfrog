Dear Charles Frog of Tenessee,

You are correct that I, Toad, live in New York. I have been busy burrowing deep into the banks of the Oswego River to make my house bigger and more comfortable. I hear that you've started kindergarden. That's a lovely place for a frog to be. Please do write soon and tell me of your adventures!

your friend, New York Toad
